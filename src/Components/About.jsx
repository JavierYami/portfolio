            <p className="text-justify text-s mb-12">I am an empathetic and communicative individual who loves working in teams. I view mistakes as opportunities for growth and am always willing to face them, find solutions, and learn from them. I also enjoy learning new technologies and staying updated on the ones I am already familiar with. Currently, I am seeking my first professional opportunity as a Full Stack, Front End, or Back End Developer. I am excited to apply my skills in a work environment and am always eager to learn. I would be extremely grateful if given the opportunity.
            Outside of work, I have a passion for video games, particularly Halo. I am a big fan of Billie Eilish, and I absolutely adore turtles. I currently have three turtles whom I love dearly. üê¢</p>
